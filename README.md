# Channel Director || Rem
## Nice to be of service.

### Introduction
I want to make a more convenient channel management system for you. *Pretty unique, isn't it?*
You can call me by prefixing your message with "cdr:"
Create a custom directory to better organize your channels.

**New? Try these commands in your server:**
```
cdr:setup
cdrLnew_channel "root" "Front Yard"
cdr:new_category "root" "Big House"
cdr:new_channel "root//Big House" "Livingroom"
```
**Required Permissions:**
```
"Manage Roles"    - To set the directory channel so that only the server owner may use it until further permissions are set.
"Manage Channels" - To create new channels.
"Manage Messages" - To manage the directory channel so that it's kept clean.
"Read Messages"   - To read commands.
"Send Messages"   - To send notifications/messages for warnings, confirmations, etc.
"Attach Files"    - To send the requested file from the command {BOT_PREFIX}save_directory.
```
*To see important announcements and command changes, Type and enter `{BOT_PREFIX}help updates`
Use this if you think a command isn't working the same way it did last time you used it.*

### Commands
Below is a list of all my commands. By each one is what permissions you need to run it yourself.
I am pretty smart so try not to exploit me.
```
Directory -- Control the directory setup
    setup             - You require the "Manage Server" and "M/Channels" permissions.

### Directory Mangement
#### SETUP; Aliases: "su"
`cdr:setup`\
**------------------------------**\
Set up your new custom directory system.\
**--** Attaching a cdr_directory.pkl file with proper contents generated by the `cdr:save_directory` command will load an existing\ directory based on that file.\
**--** You should never delete the category created by the bot. Doing this will disorganize potentially hundreds of channels under it.\
**----** Do prevent these inconveniences that I should be worried about, use the `cdr:teardown` command. I'll handle everything.\

#### TEARDOWN; Aliases: "td"
`cdr:teardown`\
**------------------------------**\
Deconstruct the custom directory system added to your server, provided by me.\
**--** IMPORTANT! Use this command especially if you have a lot of channels under the category that I created.\

### Channel Management
#### CREATE_CHANNEL; Aliases: "new_ch"\
`cdr:create_channel <directory> <name>`\
**------------------------------**\
Create a new channel under `directory` with the name `name`.\
**--** To delete a channel, simply nagivate to the channel using the directory (or manually), channel options, and click Delete Channel.\
**----** The bot will automatically update the directory. If not, use this command: `cdr:update`\

#### CREATE_CATEGORY; Aliases: "new_cat"
`cdr:create_category <directory> <name>`\
**------------------------------**\
Create a new category under `directory` with the name `name`.\

#### DELETE_CATEGORY; Aliases: "del_cat"
`cdr:delete_category <directory> <name>`\
**------------------------------**\
Delete a category, along with all channels within it.\
**-- THIS ACTION CANNOT BE UNDONE.**\

#### RENAME_CHANNEL; Aliases: "rn_ch"
`cdr:rename_channel <directory> <name> <rename>`\
**------------------------------**\
Rename the channel at the directory `directory` with name `name` to `rename`.\
**--** You cannot rename to a channel already with the same name in the same directory.\

#### MOVE_CHANNEL; Aliases: "mv_ch"
`cdr:move_channel <directory> <name> <new_directory>`\
**------------------------------**\
Moves a channel or category at the directory `directory` with name `name` to the directory `new_directory`.\
**--** You cannot move a channel or category if the destination already has a channel or category with that name.\

#### IMPORT_CHANNEL; Aliases: "imp_ch"
`cdr:import_channel <channel> <new_directory> <name>`\
**------------------------------**\
Imports an existing channel into the directory `new_directory` with the name `name`.\
**--** Your channel will not be moved or changed.\
**--** You cannot import a channel if the destination already has a channel or category with the name `name`.\

#### HIDE_CHANNEL; Aliases: "hd_ch"
`cdr:hide_channel <directory> <name>`\
**------------------------------**\
Hide an existing channel from the directory `directory` with the name `name`.\
**--** Your channel will not be moved, changed, or deleted.\
**--** To make it appear again, use the `cdr:import_channel` command to import it back in a directory.\

#### SAVE_DIRECTORY; Aliases: "save"
`cdr:save_directory`\
**------------------------------**\
Save your current directory setup to a file to be loaded later at any time.\
**--** This file contains pickled data using Python.\
**--** To load said file, use the `cdr:setup` command and attach the file to proceed.\
**----** The process takes longer depending on how many channels are in the entire directory.\

#### UPDATE
`cdr:update`\
**------------------------------**\
Updates the directory channel.\
**--** The more channels in the directory, the longer it takes to finish.\
**----** During this time, no changes can be made to the directory.\

**--** This command is automatically called when any channel in your server is deleted.\
**----** If channels are being deleted faster than the bot can update, you may have to update it manually when you are done.\

**--** The more channels that are deleted before this is called, the longer it takes to finish.\
**----** The system works by checking if a channel exists. If not, it updates internal memory and restarts.\

#### HELP
`cdr:help [section] [subsection]`\
**------------------------------**\
Sends a help message.\
**--** The `section` and `subsection` arguments:\
**----** Typing `{BOT_PREFIX}help` will give you `section` names.\
**----** If `section` is "commands", `subsection` help on a certain command.\

#### INVITE
`cdr:invite`\
**------------------------------**\
Sends an invite link to let me join a server.\
